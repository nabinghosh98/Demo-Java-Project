What is Immutable Objects?

Once the object is created, it can't be changed.

Once the Object is constructed its state can't be changed.


If you want to make a class as Immutable then mark its fields or Variables as final, so that
once it is initialized by the use of constructor then the same object fields can't be reinitialized.
So if we can't reinitialized the same object's state, then there is no need of setter method inside the class.

Therefore we can make this class as an Immutable class.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also we have to make the class as final so that no other chil class or sub class can override our class
method or variable or field property.

//Now the interviewer can ask is this class purely Immutable ?

now he asks you like he want every student should have their addresses
so therefore, A mutable Address class should be introduced inside the Immutable final class
